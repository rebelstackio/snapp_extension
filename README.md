# Snapp Extension

## Dev instalation
First we need to set our chrome extension to development mode:

- go to chrome://extensions/
- in the top right corener there is a switch "develper mode"
- now we have new buttons, we need to click the load unpacked
- set the directory the root of this project

and that's it, you have snapp beta on your browser, but we need still to run our server with puppeteer:

```bash
cd server
```
install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
start the expressif server
```bash
npm start
```
